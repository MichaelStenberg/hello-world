# hello-world

Hello Everyone,

This is me going through the intial tutorial.  Going to be starting very basically with python or other tricks but hope to have this as a repository of ideas/coding projects as I would much rather "learn coding" by making various projects even if it's a b basic project which may be a duplicate or clone of something more popular.
